This educational website was built to inform users of interesting scientific aspects of sound and music, including: the physical aspects of what consitutes sound, the frequency spectrum, how instruments produce different musical timbres, and technical basics of speakers and microphones. I underwent this independent project to explore the basics of user interface design and web development while covering a topic I'm passionate about.
